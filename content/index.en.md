This hands-on workshop guides us through building EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) clusters using Terraform Blueprints and Argo CD. It is designed for engineers, developers, and teams responsible for creating and maintaining EKS infrastructure and applications.

Throughout the workshop, we will learn how to leverage Terraform Blueprints to automate the provisioning and configuration of EKS clusters and related resources. Terraform Blueprints provide a robust framework for defining cluster settings, networking, IAM roles, and more as code. This enables consistent and repeatable EKS deployments.

The workshop will also demonstrate managing EKS configurations and deployments using Argo CD. Argo CD is a GitOps based continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes that automates syncing application definitions from Git repositories into the cluster. Using Argo CD alongside Terraform Blueprints, we will learn a GitOps workflow for declaring both infrastructure and applications.
