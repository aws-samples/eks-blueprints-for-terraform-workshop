This hands-on workshop guides us through building EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) clusters using Terraform Blueprints and Argo CD. It is designed for engineers, developers, and teams responsible for creating and maintaining EKS infrastructure and applications.

Throughout the workshop, we will learn how to leverage Terraform Blueprints to automate the provisioning and configuration of EKS clusters and related resources. Terraform Blueprints provide a robust framework for defining cluster settings, networking, IAM roles, and more as code. This enables consistent and repeatable EKS deployments.

The workshop will also demonstrate managing EKS configurations and deployments using Argo CD. Argo CD is a GitOps-based continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes that automates syncing application definitions from Git repositories to the cluster. Using Argo CD alongside Terraform Blueprints, we will learn a GitOps workflow for declaring both infrastructure and applications.

By the end of this workshop, we will have gained practical experience in:

- Provisioning EKS clusters using Terraform Blueprints
- Configuring and managing EKS clusters with Argo CD
- Implementing GitOps practices for infrastructure and application management
- Streamlining EKS deployments and operations using modern DevOps tools and techniques

This workshop provides a foundation for building scalable, maintainable, and automated EKS environments using industry-leading tools and best practices.
