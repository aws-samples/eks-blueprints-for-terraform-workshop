## AWS EKS ArgoCD Capability

This workshop specifically focuses on **AWS EKS's managed ArgoCD capability** - a fully-managed GitOps service that eliminates the operational overhead of running ArgoCD yourself. Instead of installing and maintaining ArgoCD, you simply enable this capability on your EKS clusters and AWS handles the rest.

### What You'll Learn

**Managed Service Benefits:**
- Enable ArgoCD capability with a single Terraform configuration
- Leverage AWS-managed ArgoCD with automatic updates and scaling
- Integrate seamlessly with AWS services (CodeCommit, ECR, IAM, SSO)

**Enterprise GitOps Patterns:**
- Implement hub-spoke architecture for multi-cluster management
- Set up multi-tenant environments using ArgoCD Projects
- Automate team onboarding and cluster registration
- Configure role-based access control with AWS SSO integration
