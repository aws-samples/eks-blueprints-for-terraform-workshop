## Running the workshop at an AWS Event

::alert[If we are not currently participating in an AWS organized workshop event, this section does not apply. Please skip to setup [..on your own](../self_paced).]{header="Important" type="warning"}

For this workshop, we will be provided with an AWS account through AWS Workshop Studio. Our event staff will share a link to access it. AWS Workshop Studio enables AWS field teams to run Workshops, GameDays, Bootcamps, Immersion Days, and other events requiring hands-on access to AWS accounts.
