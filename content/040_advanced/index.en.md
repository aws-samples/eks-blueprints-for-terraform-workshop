In this section, we will explore advanced modules that demonstrate additional capabilities of these projects:

- Argo CD Hub-Spoke deployment
- Blue/Green Deployment with Argo Rollouts (coming soon)
- Autoscaling with Karpenter (coming soon)
- Day 2 operations: Blue/Green EKS cluster Upgrade (coming soon)

These modules will provide deeper insights into more complex deployment patterns and operational techniques, allowing us to further leverage the power of EKS Blueprints and GitOps principles in our infrastructure management.
