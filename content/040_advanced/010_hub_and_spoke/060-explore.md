Now that we have completed the guided workshop, let's take some time to explore different aspects of what we've deployed and how we can monitor and observe our clusters.

Here are some suggested exploration activities:

- How can we remove the webstore application from the Hub Cluster to keep it running only on the spoke cluster?
- What metrics and logs can we find in CloudWatch Container Insights for our clusters?

Take this opportunity to investigate these questions and explore the capabilities of your deployed infrastructure.
