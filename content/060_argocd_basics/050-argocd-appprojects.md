### Account Token Vs Project Token

Account Tokens:
- Scope: Global server access to all projects/apps the user has permissions for.
- Duration: Fixed 12 hours
- Created from: User Settings → Tokens

Project Tokens:
- Scope: Limited to single project only
- Duration: Configurable up to 1 year
- Created from: Project Settings → Role Tokens

Recommendation is to use Project Tokens as they limit scope of the token.

We will only cover Account Token in this chpater. Project Token will be covered in "Project" chapter.
