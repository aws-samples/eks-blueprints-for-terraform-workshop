The webstore workload configuration files reside in the **workload** git repository, not in the **platform** git repository. This separation reflects the different ownership and responsibilities between the platform team ![Platform Task](/static/images/platform-task.png) and application team ![Developer Task](/static/images/developer-task.png).

In this chapter application team ![Developer Task](/static/images/developer-task.png) deploys the webstore application independently, without any direct involvement from the platform team.
