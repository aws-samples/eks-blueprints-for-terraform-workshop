In this chapter we will create EKS [Auto Mode cluster](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/auto-mode/). Amazon EKS Auto Mode fully automates Kubernetes cluster management for compute, storage, and networking. It simplifies Kubernetes management by automatically provisioning infrastructure, selecting optimal compute instances, dynamically scaling resources, continuously optimizing costs, managing core add-ons, patching operating systems, and integrating with AWS security services. Leverage the scalability and operational excellence of AWS without deep Kubernetes expertise or ongoing infrastructure management overhead. By offloading cluster operations to AWS, you can get started quickly, improve performance, and reduce overhead, letting you focus on building applications that drive innovation instead of cluster management.
