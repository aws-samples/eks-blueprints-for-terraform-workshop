Platform engineer tasks for onboarding an application typically involve creating a namespace and automating the deployment of the application. In this section, you'll set up the automation that makes application onboarding easy and repeatable. 

Once the automation is in place, platform team can onboard  workloads simply by committing configuration into a predefined folder structure. Argo CD automatically creates the necessary Kubernetes namespaces and deploys the workloads based on those definitions.
