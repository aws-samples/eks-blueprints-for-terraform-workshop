## Style Guidelines

When writing or updating workshop content, please follow these guidelines:

1. Consistently refer to the reader using "we" rather than "you" throughout the content

   - Correct: "We will create a new EKS cluster"
   - Incorrect: "You will create a new EKS cluster"

2. Use sentence case capitalization for Markdown page titles and headings, not title case

   - Correct: "Creating an EKS cluster"
   - Incorrect: "Creating An EKS Cluster"

3. Write using inclusive language that:
   - Avoids gender-specific terms (use "they" instead of "he/she")
   - Uses people-first language
   - Avoids ableist terminology
   - Is culturally sensitive and appropriate
   - Respects diversity and promotes inclusion

Following these guidelines helps create content that is consistent, professional and welcoming to all readers.
